## Overview
This project is my first hands-on experience with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python. The goal was to analyze customer churn patterns in a telecom dataset, clean and visualize the data, and extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer details, service usage, and contract information. Key columns include:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Tenure**: Duration of customer relationship
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber Optic, None)
- **Contract**: Monthly, One-year, or Two-year contract
- **TotalCharges**: Total amount paid by the customer
- **Churn**: Whether the customer left the service

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted data types, and removed duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution of churned vs. retained customers
   - Impact of tenure, contract type, and service usage on churn
   - Visual analysis of factors influencing customer retention
3. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Monthly contract customers have the highest churn rate.
   - Fiber Optic users churn more than DSL users.
   - Shorter tenure is strongly linked to customer churn.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning models to predict churn probability.
- Explore additional datasets to compare trends across industries.

## Feedback
Since this is my first project, I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Feel free to check it out and connect with me!
